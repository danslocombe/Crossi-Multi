Hi John

I am game developer currently working on a video game to be released in 2025.
My family are all morris dancers and I wanted to incorporate a traditional tune into the game.
I was recently at the Montol winter solistice festival in Penzance and heard a rendition of your fantastic song "Jump at the Sun".
I have put together an arrangement of the song and was hoping to use it in the game and promotional material, but first wanted to seek your pemission as the song writer.
If you agree it will be properly accredited and I will include your name in the credits.

I'm happy to share more details about the arrangement or the game.

Thanks
Dan
